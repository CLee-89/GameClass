While true
	create a boolean isLower and set to true
	ask user to input a phrase with lowercase letters only
	phrase = input

	for each loop for each char in phrase
		if char is not >= 'a' and <= 'z'  
			tell user to use lowercase alphabet only
			set isLower to false 
			break out of loop
	
	if isLower = true then break out of loop
End while

for each loop for each char in phrase
	char = char - 32      // Any lower case - 32 = uppercase	
End for each

output phrase

While true
	ask user to input number
	a = input
	ask user for another number
	b = input

c = a + b
